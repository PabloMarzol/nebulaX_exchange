* Onramp will conduct a KYB check of the enterprise looking to integrate.
* Onramp will schedule a call with the customer success team - who will map your requirements to the internal modularities required for the Onramp integration
* Onramp would assign the integrating partner with an **AppId** to test and proceed to production.
* Onramp will make a google space with the Onramp team - to help with any technical troubleshooting as the project goes live with Onramp be&#x20;

The merchant/partner would have range of options to choose from, to customise their revenue model, such as&#x20;

* An additional client(partner) fee can be levied upon the user for the services provided. This can be in terms of a percentage of the transaction or a flat fee(which ever works best for the Partner)&#x20;
* zero fee for user option, the Partner can choose to absorb all the costs levied on the user.

**Note**: charges would be aggregated and invoiced to the partner at the end of every month, both incase of fees to be charged, or credited.
